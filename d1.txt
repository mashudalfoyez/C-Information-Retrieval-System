Data Mining has emerged as one of the most exciting and dynamic fields in computing science. The driving force for data mining is the presence of petabyte-scale online archives that potentially contain valuable bits of information hidden in them. Commercial enterprises have been quick to recognize the value of this concept; consequently, within the span â€™ of a few years, the software market itself for data of techniques used to detect interesting nuggets of relationships/knowledge in data. While the theoretical underpinnings of the filed have been around for quite some time (in the form of pattern recognition, statistics, data analysis and machine learning), the practice and use of these techniques have been largely ad-hoc. With the availability of large databases to store, mange and assimilate data, the new thrust of data mining lies at the intersection of database systems, artificial intelligence and algorithms that efficiently analyze data. The distributed nature of several databases, their size and the complexity of many techniques present interesting computational challenges.
